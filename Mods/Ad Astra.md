## Astrodux:

### Your First Launch:

How to build your first rocket and safely travel to the moon and back.

#### Basic Materials:

[[Iron Plate]]:
- The most basic material in Ad Astra. It's created by crafting iron ingots and a hammer in a crafting table. It's used to craft the simplest machines required to build a rocket and get into space.
- [[Hammer]] - Ad Astra

[[Steel Plate]]:
- Steel Plates are the main component in the tier one rocket and in many important machines. It's created by compressing steel ingots in a compressor, which can be powered by a coal generator. Be sure to collect lots of steel plates, as you will need it throughout your space travels.

[[Coal Generator]]
[[Compressor]]

#### Your First Rocket:

[[NASA Workbench]]:
- In order to build a rocket, you must first collect all of the parts: cone, plates, fins, tanks, and engine. You can then make the rocket in a NASA workbench, a specially designed workbench just for rockets.

[[Launchpad]]:
- To place your newly-created rocket, you must build a launchpad.
- After the launchpad has been built, place the rocket in the center.

#### Fuel:
- Even after you place your rocket, you will not be able to fly just yet. To fly, you will need to fill the rocket with fuel.
- 
[[Oil]]:
- Oil is found in large amounts spouting over the ocean surface. Collect as much oil as you can, as oil is non-renewable, and you need a lot of it for each rocket launch.

[[Fuel]]:
- After collecting enough oil (at least six buckets for a launch and return), you will need to refine the oil into fuel. To do this, you will need to craft a fuel refinery. Power it, then place the oil in the left slot, and it will be refined into fuel.

[[Fuel Refinery]]:
- Shift-click on the rocket to open its inventory, then place three buckets of fuel into the input slot. Place the other three buckets into the rocket's inventory for a return trip.

#### Oxygen:
- At this point, you can launch your rocket; however, you will likely die very fast, as there is no oxygen on the moon. In order to survive on the moon, you will need an oxygenated space suit and an ample oxygen supply.

[[Space Helmet]], [[Space Suit]], [[Space Pants]], [[Space Boots]]

[[Oxygen]]:
- To obtain oxygen, it must be extracted from water. An oxygen loader is required to do this. Craft one, then place water in the left tank, and watch it convert into oxygen. You must repeat this process many times until you have enough oxygen.

[[Oxygen Loader]]:
- Oxygen can then be extracted by collecting it in a bucket, spacesuit, or an oxygen tank. After you have enough oxygen, you are moments away from launching your first rocket!

#### Preparing to Launch:
- Follow these steps very carefully! Missing even one thing here could make your life tough, or worse, cause you to be stranded on the moon!
- In order to return to Earth from the Moon, you need two basic things: a launch pad and three buckets of fuel.
- Place these items in the inventory of your rocket, and ensure that you always have them every time you launch a rocket. Finally, you should bring multiple full oxygen tanks, plentiful food, soul torches or glowstone, weapons, and tools. Once you have this, you are ready to launch. Enter the rocket and press Space!

#### The Moon:
- Congratulations on reaching the moon! The moon is a barren wasteland, grey and dead, as far as the eye can see; however, underground is where you will find the next major resource in Ad Astra - [[Desh]]!
- [[Desh]] is used to craft advanced machines, space stations, and the tier two rocket.
- To return back to earth, open your lander (shift + rightclick) and collect the rocket, fuel, and the launch pad. To remove the lander, punch it. Set up the launch pad, place the rocket down and fill it up with fuel. Press space to fly back to earth.



### The Moon:
- You've discovered a new extraterrestrial metal called [[Desh]], unlocking the ability to fly to Mars.

#### Space Station:
- A space station is a pre-built structure that is selected in the planet selection screen, provided you have the necessary materials. Space stations are always located in a moon or planet's orbit and provide the ability to place blocks in that orbit dimension.
- Space stations are designed to be expanded upon, allowing you to build the base of your dreams over a moon/planet. They always spawn in whatever position you launched your rocket at, so remember the coordinates to avoid losing the structure.

#### Solar Panel:

[[Solar Panel]]:
- The solar panel is an upgraded version of the [[Coal Generator]], producing more energy per tick while being self-reliant. Its power generation depends on the planet's distance from the sun and fog. Because of this, it is more efficient to place solar panels close to the sun. Solar panels also produce more energy in orbit, as there is no atmosphere blocking the light.
- Check the tooltip or GUI to see how much energy is being produced in the current world.

#### Oxygen Distributor:
[[Oxygen Distributor]]:
- The oxygen distributor is a powerful machine that distributes oxygen in a sealed room, allowing any life inside to survive. It works exactly like an [[Oxygen Loader]], where you insert water into the tank, but instead of giving you oxygen, the oxygen is distributed into the air.

[[Water Pump]]:
- The water pump is essential for keeping the oxygen distributor running infinitely. To use it, place an infinite water source below, then place the water pump above one of the water blocks, and then place the oxygen distributor adjacent to it. Make sure to supply both the pump and the oxygen distributor with sufficient power.

- Once you have supplied the oxygen distributor with an infinite water source, sufficient energy, and a completely sealed room, it will distribute oxygen in that room. To check that oxygen is being distributed, click "show" in the distributor GUI. If you see bubbles floating around, that means that the room is being supplied with oxygen.
- If there is a hole in your structure that is causing oxygen to escape, the distributor GUI will provide a warning. Patch the hole to avoid unnecessary power draw and oxygen usage. After that, you should be able to take off your oxygen suit and survive. Each oxygen distributor can support up to 2000 blocks, allowing you to build a moderately sized space station or base. If you need more, you can place more oxygen distributors.

Ventilation:
- Inside your oxygenated structure, you should provide proper ventilation to ensure that oxygen does not get blocked when a door is closed. To do this, you can create a one-block gap in between walls or use a vent block to allow oxygen flow.

#### Rover:

[[Rover]]:
- The rover is a land vehicle capable of driving on the rough terrain of moons and planets. It's exceptionally fast, has an inventory capable of storing eight items, and has two seats for multiple riders. To use it, fill the rover with fuel (shift-click and place fuel buckets in the left input slot).

#### Cables:
- Cables allow for long-range energy transfer. There are two variants, [[Steel Cable]] and [[Desh Cable]]s, desh with a higher transfer rate. When used with a wrench, cables can be configured to extend in directions or to disconnect from nodes in the network.
- [[Wrench]]

#### Mars:
- Now that you have explored the moon and worked with desh, you want to take it further and go to the red planet. Building a tier two rocket capable of travelling to Mars is similar to building the tier one rocket, but with desh materials instead of steel. Construct the parts, build the rocket in the NASA workbench, fuel it up, and off you go to Mars!

[[Ostrum]]:
- Ostrum is the next material that you seek on the red planet. It is used to craft more powerful space armor, build exceptional machines and to construct a rocket capable of withstanding extreme heat, allowing you to travel to hot planets.

#### Lunarians:
- Throughout the moon, there are large, inhabited underground villages. These villages contain an alien form of the earth villager, who call themselves Lunarians. Unlike their earth counterparts, Lunarians don't need oxygen and can survive the chilling environment of the moon.
- Lunarians have different trades than earth villagers, featuring planet-specific materials, space suits, and oxygen gear.
- [[Lunarian Wandering Traders]] appear on every moon and planet. They have many rocket-related trades that may save your life, including launch pads, oxygen, fuel, soul torches and water. They accept emeralds, which are commonly found in the various structures on the moon and planets.

### Surviving Mars:

You've landed on Mars with one goal in mind - to mine as much Ostrum as possible to get to Venus and Mercury.

#### Trophies:
- [[Globes]] are trophy blocks found as a reward at the end of the dungeon. They offer no practical function and are instead a deocration block. They can be spun around by right-clicking or can spin together when powered by redstone.
- [[Space Painting]]s are found in chests throughout dungeons. They work exactly like regular painting but only place paintings from this mod. There are 14 pieces to look for.

#### Fluid Pipes:
- [[Fluid Pipes]] are similar to cables, but with fluid transfer instead of energy transfer. To use them, craft some fluid pipes and a wrench. Then, right-click on one of the pipes with the wrench to cycle through pipe modes: 'none', 'normal', 'insert', and 'extract'.
- [[Desh Fluid Pipe]]

#### Energizer:
- The [[Energizer]] is a machine capable of powering items and storing large amounts of energy. To charge an item, power the energizer and then right-click on the energizer with that item. It stores 2 million energy, meaning it can charge machines for a very long time. It will store energy when broken.

#### Better Fuel:

- [[Cryo Freezer]]: Fuel is hard to get, it requires venturing into the ocean and looking for oil spouts. The Cryo Freezer introduces a new way to obtain a better fuel, [[Cryo Fuel]]. It is much more efficient than refined fuel, allowing you to launch a rocket with just one bucket. It's created by collecting ice shards, which are found as an ore underground on cold planets. The ice shard then needs to be inserted into a Cryo Freezer, and it will convert to 25 mB of Cryo Fuel. Alternatively, you can convert ice, packed ice, and blue ice to fuel. Once you've made at least two buckets (one for a launch and one for a return trip), place the buckets in the rocket fuel slot.
- In addition to being an excellent fuel, cryo fuel has some other features. When placed, it will damage anything inside, similar to lava. It also freezes water, allowing for an infinite ice source. 

#### Netherite Space Suit:
- [[Netherite Space Suit]]: The Netherite Space Suit is an upgraded version of the standard space suit, featuring permanent fire resistance, more protection, and the ability to survive on Venus and Mercury. Before you travel to these planets, you must craft the netherite space suit armor or else you will burn to death.

#### Calorite:
- Once you have enough Ostrum to craft a complete netherite space suit set and all of the components of the tier three rocket, you can travel to Venus and Mercury. Please note that if you enter these planets without a netherite space suit or fire resistance, you will die very fast. The next material that you seek is [[Calorite]]. Calorite is used to craft the ultimate rocket capable of travelling to a new solar system.
