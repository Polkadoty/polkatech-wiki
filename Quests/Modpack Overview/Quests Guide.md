Things you gotta do

Quests in this modpack have four different shapes, each with a different meaning.
- Cogs - Represent processes that need to be automated
- Circles - Represent checkbox tasks that need to be done
- Squares - Represent items to collect
- Hexagons - Represents repeatable trading quests/ways to earn money.

There are a couple of other rare symbols you may see here and there to indicate extremely important quests.

If you see a [[]] surrounding text, that means that is a mod-name. On the wiki, that is clickable and it will take you directly to that modpage.
