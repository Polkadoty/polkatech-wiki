Cosmetics, Trinkets, and More

If you haven't played with Trinkets or Artifacts before, some of these items may seem a bit weird.

Open up your inventory and hover over the icons to see trinket slots. When you find rare and valuable items, they go into these slots. Some of the mods that add these are as follows:
- [[Artifacts]]
- [[Trinkets]]
- [[Things]]
- [[Simply Hats]]
- [[Rings of Ascension]]
- [[Simple Magnets]]

There is an additional set of cosmetic armor slots indicated by the little eye in the icon. 

## Rewards:
