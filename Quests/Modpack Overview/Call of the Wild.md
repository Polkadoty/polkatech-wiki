Hundreds of Biomes to Explore

There are over two hundred new biomes in this pack between [[Regions Unexplored]], [[Terralith]], and other biome mods. One of the first things you will notice when joining is that the terrain generation looks very different. All of these biomes and their respective blocks are built into recipes, and some items you'll need for progression are a bit tricky to get. To help you get started, have a [[Nature's Compass]]:
