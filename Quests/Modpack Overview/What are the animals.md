Just adding some variety

A variety of mods in this pack add animals. Some are biome-specific, like [[Brown Bear]], [[Ecologics]] mobs, and the [[Fish of Thieves]] fish. [[Naturalist]] adds a ton of animals to the world and has been modified to integrate them into modded biomes. [[Wildlife]] does the same thing.

Soon:
