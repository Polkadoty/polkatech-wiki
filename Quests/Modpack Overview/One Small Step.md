Before one giant leap

"You've taken your first step into a larger world" - Obi-Wan Kenobi

Welcome to PolkaTech. This modpack is a spiritual successor to GregTech, for newer versions of Minecraft, while removing some of the grindier bits and giving a ton of variety.

In a couple hours, you will hopefully have explored some of the many new biomes, gathered resources, looted structures, and automated at least one resource. For now, let's get you started with the pack.

If you need extra help, then please visit the discord server. The links are at the top of this page and clickable.

Most of the topics are explained in the wiki, which is where these quests and a lot of supplemental information are located. Check that as well.

If you want a program to help you see an overview of progression, check out the wiki for an interactive tree of all the different features.
