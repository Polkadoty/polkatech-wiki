What you'll be doing

As you'll see shortly, the overall progression of the mod is as follows:

1. Stone Age
	- About Automating Cobblestone and all of its derivative resources with [[Create]]
	- Getting some basic gear to stay alive
	- Exploring the world and finding a village
	- Doing some missions through Bountiful
2. Early Industrialization
	- Getting electric power from Create to use with other tech mods
	- Creating the first [[Applied Energistics 2]] Storage System
	- Using Steam Power to make automation of previous resources faster
	- Creating an alloy smelter
3. Low-Voltage Age
	- The LV Stage of [[Modern Industrialization]]
	- Starting point of Tech Reborn and Industrial Revolution
	- Integrate Create trains, automated mines, and beginnings of automating most resources.
4. Netherite Age 
	- Gather a full set of Netherite gear that can be upgraded with other gems
	- Begin Andesite Imbuement and magic farming
	- Start your first automated trading
5. Medium-Voltage Age
	- Where the pack starts getting difficult, all of these machines from here onwards will scale much better than LV machines.
	- Integrating all of [[Tech Reborn]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]
	- End of large-scale Create automation, fully high-tech now
	- The first multiverse generator will be created here.
6. Space Age
	- Building and fueling a rocket, going to the moon and establishing a permanent space presence
	- Building in the void dimension now is the best choice for large-scale automation.
	- Magic mod automation now becomes a key way to progress to HV
7. High-Voltage Age
	- By now your world will be hundreds if not thousands of days old
	- You can automate nearly every resource imaginable
	- Your limitation is HV and time. Building scalable systems is key
	- The multiverse generator is now much more scalable. Create infinite multiverses to explore and gather resources in.
8. End-game
	- Maxing out [[Modern Industrialization]], [[Tech Reborn]], and [[Industrial Revolution]] machines
	- Getting to the quantum gear and time machine.
	- TODO: Entering the Primal Age
