Nights in this modpack are rough. The reworked mobs are a lot tougher than you may be used to. Around 30% of the mobs will spawn with gear from [[Epic Knights]] (rusty chainmail, weapons, etc.). Zombies will now spawn after a nearby mob is hit. [[Zenith]] bosses and [[Eldritch Mobs]] will make life more difficult.

Before automating anything, your first objective is to get a bed and some good gear.
