Welcome to PolkaTech. This modpack is a spiritual successor to GregTech, but for newer versions of Minecraft, while removing some of the grindier bits and giving a ton of variety. The goal is simple, have the ability to hit endgame with any of the tech mods in the pack. From Create, Industrial Revolution, Botania, Modern Industrialization, Tech Reborn, and more, mix and match systems seamlessly through converter blocks and modified progression. Thousands of KubeJS recipes and tweaks later, as well as custom compatibility patches and manually ported mods, here it is.

## Long-term Pack Goal?

Build the multiversal time machine to enter into the past and the Primal Dimension. There are a variety of ways to achieve this. Purely by farming, exploring, mining, automating, and more, you will have enough to buy the time machine and enter. Based on the upcoming Block Survival Crafted mod by Polkadoty, you'll be thrust into a dinosaur filled primal dimension with nothing but the skin on your back. Enjoy the content of the modpack again, but with a new twist. Use dinosaur DNA to start your own genetics program and introduce modified species back into the normal timeline!

## Explore a Variety of Tech Mods

Between space exploration, steampunk automation, advanced metallurgy, over 500 biomes to explore, 4-5 new dimensions, 8 new endgame items and packs, and so much more, there is a lot to do. Become an engineering prodigy by automating your resource gathering, processing, and crafting. Harness the power of machinery to optimize your gameplay.

## Get that Dopamine Rush

Challenge yourself with over 1000 quests designed for this modpack. Complete missions that level you up to the next stage of progression, complete with comprehensive rewards.

## Explore a Beautiful New World

Using a combination of Regions Unexplored, Terralith, Terrestria, Nyctophobia, and more, see a beautiful and fantastical landscape dotted with new structures to explore. The End and Nether have been overhauled as well with Better End/Nether, Cinderscapes, Amplified Nether, Nullscape, and more. The Deep Dark dimension will be a terrifying place to explore.

If something out of this world is more your fancy, use the rockets built into Ad Astra and Create to explore the cosmos. Visit both a reimagined solar system and a couple new solar systems from scifi, all with new blocks, biomes, atmospheres, and challenges.

## Enjoy Deeper Combat

Even though the main focus of progression is with tech, that doesn't mean that combat has been left out. Better Combat, Combat Roll, Simply Skulls, Epic Knights, and more give a much higher skill curve for combat, while mob reworks, new structures, bosses, dungeons, and more make combat more exhilarating.

## Questing and Trading

With the Bounty Board, Trading Post, Bartering Post, and expanded villagers, building an economy with your villagers is easier than before. Now instead of penning in your villagers to sort them by type, feel free to trade with them all in once place. Villagers will now trade modded blocks, and emeralds will become the lifeblood of your economy. If there's something that just doesn't interest you to automate, build a trading table, and buy the materials you need from the network of villages around the world. By placing multiple trading tables in different villages, enjoy cheaper prices on specific goods tied to that village, encouraging diversification in exports.

## The Spices of Life

Want to do something a bit different? Be a farmer and sell your goods on the market. Bake and cook valuable goods to make a higher profit. Automate a variety of crops using Farmer's Delight, Croptopia, Vinery, Croparia, and more. Getting exotic ingredients from other dimensions will boost the value of your recipes dramatically.
